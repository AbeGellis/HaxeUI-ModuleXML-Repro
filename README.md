# HaxeUI-ModuleXML-Repro
Minimal reproduction case for a problem I'm encountering trying to use classes defined by haxeui module.xml

After cloning, run the usual commands to set up:
```
mkdir Libraries
cd Libraries
git clone https://github.com/haxeui/haxeui-core.git
git clone https://github.com/haxeui/haxeui-kha.git
git clone https://github.com/haxefoundation/hscript.git
```
and initialize the Kha project.
